        <h3>The Knowledge I have gain.</h3>
        <p>
          In the 8 months that I have been at DevPipeline I gain knowledge in
          Python, Html, Css, Javascript and React. With each language I have
          many struggles and a lot of frustration but when I am able to make
          something work I can't wait to work on something new. I have learned
          that perfection is not always attainable but self excellent is. Just
          being better than you were yesterday is the goal.
